# Smart_RainFall_Measurement_System_Using_IOT
A rain gauge is an important tool to help monitor global weather patterns, aid farmers dealing with drought and help meteorologists prepare for natural disasters. Temperature affects the growth and reproduction of plants and animals, with warmer temperatures promoting biological growth. Air temperature also affects nearly all
other weather parameters. In this project, a model is developed that will measure the rainfall in the rain gauge and it will measure the temperature too. Ultrasonic sensor is used to measure rainfall and a temperature sensor is used to measure temperature. To make the rain gauge automatically empty itself, a servo motor is used. ESP module is used to connect to the internet. Data is visualized on a think speak platform. After measuring the rain and temperature the details are sent to the user through email notification.
